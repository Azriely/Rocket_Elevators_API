## Project Description
This is a ruby on rails project for Rocket Elevators. Our goal was to make an interactive website with a team member's original static site, and link it to a database; storing the employee login and quote data in separate tables. The site includes a back office section allowing employees to login and access the stored data.

#### Back Office Instructional Video
This video gives a brief explanation of the process for submitting a quote form to the Back Office, as well as, describing the creation of a submission and how to access the Back Office to view said submission.<br />
